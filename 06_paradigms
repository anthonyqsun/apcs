Racket/scheme:
(display "Hello, World!")

Netlogo:
print "Hello, World!"

Python:
print("Hello, World!")

each have an output keyword/function and "Hello, World!" at the end in quotes (string).
Racket uses prefix notation and has parentheses around function calls, netlogo doesn't require parentheses, and python needs parentheses after the print keyword to call.

q0: I think so. Every square has at least two exit and entry points, so a solution can be found no matter what.
Experimental proof: the board can be broken down into 4 equivalent parts, so we only need to consider a 4x4 quadrant. If there are enough solutions to have a start or end point at all 16 of the (1-4)x(1-4) spots, then there must be a solution from any position.

q1: yes; if one closed tour solution exists, the algorithm only needs to find the existing closed tour path to complete the solution.

q2: each increment to n adds 2n-1 squares to consider, with each square being an exponential increase to the runtime.

q3: maybe break the board up into a 5x5 chunk, solve that first, and have that be the starting board.


2. -> proceed forward until you hit a wall.
   -> turn right 90 degrees
   -> follow the left wall until you come across an exit

- while loops operate similarly to python's while loops
- python for loops are actually for each loops. java for loops are a "glorified while loop"
- for (initialization; test; increment)
- do while loops execute something at least once and continues executing as long as a condition is true
- break breaks you out of the current loop
- continue skips the current iteration of the loop
(unsure of how to do myexp)

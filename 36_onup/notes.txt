Errors:
	Compile-time: syntax wrong
	run-time: program runs into an error
	Logic error: does not produce expected results

Compile-time:
If fixing compile-time errors doesn't work, check if you are compiling the right file.
Debugging by bisection: delete half the code and rerun.

Run-time:
If program hangs, print something out before and after each loop.
An infinite recursion will result in a StackOverflowError
You can also print something like "entering method foo" before running a method to see what's been run.

Exceptions tell you what went wrong in your code.

Logic errors:
Runtime prints can be useful here as well to print variables to understand what's going on.
If a large expression doesn't work the way it's intended, you should test each part of it or split it into smaller sections.

After finding a bug, think on why it happened and plan to avoid it in the future.

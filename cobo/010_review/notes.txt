1.
a. sentimentVal( String word )
b. it requires a String. it throws an error if a different type is given as an argument
c. yes, it returns a double

2.
Method call:			Return value:
sentimentVal("happily");	2.32
sentimentVal("terrible");	-3.38
sentimentVal("cold");		-0.04
sentimentVal("zero");		-0.4
sentimentVal("yes");		0.92
sentimentVal("younger");	1.03

3.
a. this would compile; a String is passed into sentimentVal() and a double is returned
b. this would not compile; a double is passed into sentimentVal()
c. this would not compile; two Strings are being passed into sentimentalVal()

4.
totalSentiment begins by creating a sentiment double starting at 0. A String array is created by running split on the String version of a file.	1.03

totalSentiment begins by creating a sentiment double starting at 0. A String array is created by running split on the String version of a file. The array is iterated through, and sentiment is incremented by the sentiment value of the current String in the iteration.

5.
a. The ratings some some sense, as phrases with higher sentiment values have higher ratings. However, short ratings with high praise aren't considered to be of high star rating.
b. A possible way to improve this is to check sentiment value against word count. Another could be to adjust some threshold values to make the starRating more accurate.

6. The student made it so that the final return can only be reached if totalSentiment is above 14. To fix it, he could reverse all the compare signs in the if statements.

3. indexOf iterates through the String it's called on to find a target, returning the index of the first occurence. The substring method takes indicies as arguments and returns a substring defined by those indicies. To divide a String into two parts, we can find the index of the first occurence of the pattern we're trying to find, and use substring to partition the String. It's necessary to add 1 to the position of the space when copying the remainder of the String because we don't want the space to be part of our word.

- create a new array by doing type[] name = new type[number of elements];
- java arrays are indexed the same ways as python does (starts at 0)
- you cannot use negative indexing in java (like when it loops around)
- you can access array length by calling arrayname.length 
- you can use a foreach/enhanced loop like in python: for(type element:array)

- did not know how to do the histogram for exercise 1
- didn't know how to do exercise 8
